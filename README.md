# Target Shooting Game

This project directory contains three scenes: `HelloUnity` (Step 4), `ShootingBall` (Step 5), and `TargetShootingGame` (Step 6). The final scene, `TargetShootingGame`, showcases the completed game with the following features:

- **Pretty Landscape**: Includes Fence objects, a textured plane for the ground, and a beautiful skybox.
- **Three Moving Targets**: Each target has independent speeds and point values, providing varying challenges for the player.
- **Countdown Timer**: The game starts with a 60-second timer, and when it expires, "Game Over" is displayed.
- **Score System**: The player's score increments as they successfully shoot targets.
- **Projectile Mechanics**: A small projectile ball is launched each time the screen is tapped.
