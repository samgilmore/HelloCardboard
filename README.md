# Target Shooting Game

This project directory contains three scenes: `HelloUnity` (Step 4), `ShootingBall` (Step 5), and `TargetShootingGame` (Step 6). The final scene, `TargetShootingGame`, showcases the completed game with the following features:

- **Pretty Landscape**: Includes Fence objects, a textured plane for the ground, and a beautiful skybox.
- **Three Moving Targets**: Each target has independent speeds and point values, providing varying challenges for the player.
- **Countdown Timer**: The game starts with a 60-second timer, and when it expires, "Game Over" is displayed.
- **Score System**: The player's score increments as they successfully shoot targets.
- **Projectile Mechanics**: A small projectile ball is launched each time the screen is tapped.

## Game Description:

This target shooting game is definitionally a game because it meets the core criteria outlined in our class discussions. Like any game, it has clear rules and a quantifiable goal: players must shoot moving targets within a 60-second time limit, earning points based on the type of target hit. The game requires skill and focus to hit the targets and maximize the score. It has a defined beginning (starting the timer) and an end (when the timer runs out), and the outcome is variable depending on how many targets the player can hit. There’s a clear challenge presented to the player, with satisfaction coming from improving their score or hitting harder targets.

The game also fits Schell and Juul’s definitions because it introduces a level of emotional investment for the player. The player feels engaged as they try to beat their own score or hit faster-moving targets, and there’s a sense of accomplishment when scoring higher points or seeing the “Game Over” screen after a successful round. The game environment, with its pretty landscape and moving targets, enhances the immersion, providing both a goal-oriented experience and a fun challenge that mirrors the emotional engagement described in our readings.
